git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Praveen-30/Month_tracking.git    to link an existing local repo to remote repo
git remote -v 

git status 
git add .     to add files to staging area from unstaging

git commit -m " non empty comments"
git push
git checkout -b <branch name>    after this    
git push -u origin <branch name> this will  reflect branch in repository
git branch 
git rm Hello.txt      after this   -> git push  to reflect changes in github

git checkout-b <branch name> followed by 
git push -u origin <Branch name>

If you’re on the branch you want to rename:
git branch -m new-branch-name

git push origin --delete branch   This is to delete remote branch

If you’re on a different branch:
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name   isnt it working same that of git checkout-b <branch-name>??
git push origin new-branch-name    This push is compulsory for the changes to be visible at repo
